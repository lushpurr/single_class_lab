# The files for this section can be found in single_class_lab_start_code/student_class

# You should write your code in the the src/student.py file. The tests we have provided are in tests/student_test.py They are all skipped at the moment. You should work through the tests one at a time, deleting the line which causes the test to skip.

# To run the tests:

# python3 run_tests.py

# Tasks
# Create a class called Student that has the properties Name (str) and Cohort (str).
# Create an __init__ method that takes in a name (str) and a cohort (str - e.g "E41", "G19", etc) to initialise the properties when a new student is created.
# Create a talk method that gets the student to talk, returning "I can talk!".
# Create a method, say_favourite_language that takes in a students favourite programming language and returns it as part of a string (eg. student.say_favourite_language("Python") -> "I love Python").
